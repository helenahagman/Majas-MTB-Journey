        <h2>About Maja</h2>
        <p>Maja was born in March 2013 and since then she's been in constant motion. She loves sports and when she's not on her bike
            she also competes in both swimming and tennis. MTB is her passion and even if 2022 was her first year of competeing in MTB 
            she came in 3rd place in SWECUP. So 2023 we are looking forward to follow her progress on a brand new custombuilt bike.
